# Google-Stock-Price-Prediction


In this notebook, I will work with data downloded from Yahoo Finance to predict Google's stock price using LSTM to realize multi-variable time series forecasting. Furthermore, in this project, I Investigated and implemented 3 deep learning algorithms (LSTM, GRU, Transformer) on the stock price prediction. Utilized data prepossessing via sklearn, matplotlib, pandas to transform the values in data with the help of the fit transform function; used min-max scaler for scaling the data to bring all the price values to a common scale. And Implemented LSTM, GRU and Transformer on the processed dataset via sklearn, pandas, pytorch. Optimized the hyperparameters (number of layers, optimization methods) via grid search
